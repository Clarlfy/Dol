	"Always fly high, prey won't see you," <<bhe>> instructs. "Be fast. Never let prey anticipate your strike." You keep flying over the moor, looking for an opportune moment. Soon, your mate spots something. "There," <<bhe>> says, turning towards movement in the heather. A scattered group of lurkers. "Watch. Will show <<wife>> how to strike."

You came here to hunt, and hunt you will.
<br><br>

Using your wings to swoop downward isn't something you're familiar with, but your instincts guide you. It feels similar to muscle memory, as your wings fold and your arms rear back for a grab. Your mind hones in on your target, and the rushing air is all you can hear. The lurkers aren't expecting another attack, allowing you to catch one easily.
<br><br>

The recovery isn't as easy. The sudden weight shift and the returning force from grabbing an object at high speed throws you off balance. You manage to right yourself, but you're too close to the ground. You instinctively lower your legs, making contact with the ground. You run with your momentum and use the speed to take off again.
<br><br>

It struggles in your hands. You manage to pick up wind and soar to the sky. As soon as you reach the clouds, the creature falls limp.
