<br><br>

You get to work demolishing the old nest. It doesn't take long. You throw out any old wood or leaves and sort anything still usable by size and strength.
You also make sure to save the fabric from your last improvements to the nest.
<br><br>

Inspiration strikes you, and you decide to make the nest raised from the ground. You cross large pieces of wood as a foundation, leaving space for the nest itself to hang.
You also add in some random shiny junk. It won't improve the structure, but it's inexplicably pleasing to look at.
Your spouse works on the nest itself, and the two of you lift the base of it onto the frame you've made.
<br><br>

While <<bhe>> finishes meticulously placing each stick and log, you begin to sew fabric and lurker leather into small sacks and fill them with leaves. It's the closest thing you'll get to a pillow out here.
<br><br>

You fill the nest with leaves, and throw two sewn sheets of fabric over the top. They're large enough to hang over the edges. Finally, you throw in your makeshift pillows. All that's left is to test it out.

<<effects>>

An idea strikes you. You could use a small change in elevation and a couple of tubes to fill the pot with water from the rainwater pool, heating it, before returning it back.
<br><br>

You fashion some tubes with leather and fabric. It's a bit leaky, but it will do.
You stick one of the tubes in the pool and apply a bit of suction before dropping it in the pot. Water starts flowing in to be heated. You repeat the process with the other tube, and water begins flowing both ways.

You're sure this would earn you some praise from Sirris.

With a little more elbow grease, you could vastly improve the design of your drying rack.

You start from scratch, carving the legs and rods out of sturdy wood capped with a bit of scrap to protect it from the heat.
You then thatch together side supports with sticks and leather, allowing the whole assembly to fold in and out for easier storage.
<br><br>

Once that's done, you get to work building a ventilated cover for it. The strange fumes should harmlessly escape the tower, now.
<br><br>

You wipe your forehead and admire your handiwork. You should be able to dry out plenty of lurkers at once.

It looks a little uncanny. You're not entirely sure why you built it, but seeing your things collected together like this is pleasing nonetheless. <<stress -6>><<lstress>>

You weave together salvaged clothing into a large curtain. The Great Hawk occasionally looks over your shoulder. It takes a long time, but when you're done, it's large enough to cover the entire broken wall. You use a long stick and some wood to fashion a simple opening mechanism. You show your spouse how to open it.
<br><br>

Your nest looks a little plain. You embed a piece of fabric with some of the shiny junk you've collected, and tie it to the base, hanging over the edge of the tower.
<br><br>

You build a simple display rack for a particularly empty section of the tower, using fabric and leaves as a pleasing backdrop for some valuables you've stolen.
<br><br>

You add some more shiny things to the shelter tarp above you, then move to your mirror. You use your tools to carve a new wooden frame for it to slide into, and add some leaves around it for a natural look. You hang some lurkers from the top. You step back and look around the tower again. Being surrounded by little memories like this is reassuring. <<stress -24>><<trauma -6>><<lllstress>><<ltrauma>>

You pile up your hunting trophies once more. There's a lot to go through.

Over the course of about an hour, you cover an entire wall with shiny things you've snagged over time. You add some to the base of your nest, around your mirror, and to your wardrobe. Everything has a pleasing glint somewhere on its surface.
<br><br>

You take a hefty piece of firewood and bind lurkers all around it. You sharpen some sticks and use them to display more lurkers. You start to hang them on any surface that will hold them.
<br><br>

The walls of your tower tell the stories of countless hunts, and tease more to come. Your spouse looks around, seemingly stunned at all you've accomplished.

You pile up a bunch of wood and prepare your tools. This will be a big project.
<br><br>

Wood carving takes up the bulk of the time. You need to make sure it has the right shape and structure. Once you have a standing frame, it becomes much easier.
<br><br>

The walls are next. You use your largest pieces for it, and use a mix of fabric and leather to bind pieces together. You wish you had some glue. You carve notches near the top as even as you can, both to accept a roof piece and for sticks to support hangars.
<br><br>

The roof piece is a bit heavy, but you lock it in place after a few tries. Finally, you carve sticks and tie bent pieces of junk to the tops to serve as hangars. You use lurkers for heavier hangars. Their stiff limbs stay in place when you bend them.
<br><br>

You stand up and admire your work. You swell with pride. <<trauma -12>><<lltrauma>>

It will serve as the trapping mechanism, but for now you're using it to sling the rest of the materials you need over your shoulder as you walk down the stairs to the courtyard of the castle.
<br><br>

You look around for a good spot, and see a bit of displaced grass. Something travels back and forth here frequently. You dig a small hole and drop in a piece of thick wood, and get to work rigging up the trap. You use a piece of shiny junk as bait.
