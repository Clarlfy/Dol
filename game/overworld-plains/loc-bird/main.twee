Your worries dissipate as <<bhe>> <<if $monster is 1>>walks<<else>>hops<</if>> towards the edge of the perch.

<br><br>
<<if $monster is 1>>
	"You are ready. Come."
<</if>>
<<bHe>> motions you towards the ledge.
You approach, and your stomach begins to tie itself in a knot. You knew you were up high, but the idea of actually jumping is catching up to you.
Your vision begins to blur, and the ground looks to be getting further and further away despite you moving forward.
<<if $monster is 1>>
	You feel a hand on your shoulder. "I believe in you, <<wife>>."

The air rushing by your head is deafening. The ground slowly gets closer and closer. You feel the urge to scream, but it gets caught in your throat.
Your arms and legs begin to feel numb, and the edges of your vision begin to darken. Soon, the only things you can feel are your racing heart and your beating wings. <<ggstress>>
<br><br>
You don't even know when your wings started moving, but they're beating furiously. They're moving out of sync and in different directions, leaving feathers in the air behind you.
It feels like hours have passed since you were pushed over. You manage to look behind you, and see the Great Hawk rapidly descending towards you. Everything fades to black. <<stress 1000>><<gggstress>>
<br><br>
When your eyes open again, the ground is barely any closer. In fact, it almost looks like it's getting further away.
Your ears briefly ring, but you can hear an intense wind. You feel it, too. It's carrying you.

You open your wings as wide as you can, and you catch the wind.

The wind pushes you higher and higher into the air. You level out your body and angle your wings.
You drop briefly, causing a jolt of nausea to shoot through you, but you manage to hold. Before you know it, you're gliding forwards.
<br><br>
The deafening wind grows quiet, and you start to regain feeling in your limbs and head. The ground no longer looks like certain death.
You hear the beating of another pair of wings behind you.
<br><br>
<<if $monster is 1>>
	The Great Hawk catches up to you, arms stretched to either side as <<bhe>> rears <<bhis>> wings to match your speed.

When you reach the perch, you can't feel your legs touch solid ground. You collapse as soon as <<bhe>> lets you go, but <<bhe>> catches you.
