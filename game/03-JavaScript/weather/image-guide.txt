Normal maps are used to get depth in the lighting.

However, there are restrictions to reading image data when loading the game locally.
To avoid this, we can convert the normal map to a base64 string instead of using the basic image,
then paste the string into an array.

There are simple online tools that can convert an image to a base64 string, like this one: https://www.base64-image.de
