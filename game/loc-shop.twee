You feel light-headed as you regain consciousness. Your vision clears, and you find yourself facing out a window onto the High Street. You cannot move an inch, but you're stood upright. You feel straps against your skin, they must be holding you steady. They're also contorting your limbs into a specific pose; your hands are resting on your hips and your head is cocked to one side.<br><br>

Once your bewilderment subsides, you notice you are wearing nothing but a white string bikini. The implication suddenly dawns on you when a young blond woman stops in front of the window and stares. You feel blood rush to your face at the humiliation, but she moves on without a flicker of realisation on her face.<br><br>

<<click [[Next|Abduction Shop]]>><<pass60>><<set $trauma to $trauma + 20>><</click>>



<<elseif $phase is 1>>

An hour passes without event. More people look at you through the window but none realise you aren't a mannequin. Most people just pass you by without a glance.<br><br>

You feel less groggy now, and can even twitch a bit. You'll regain control of your body soon, but that still leaves the straps.<br><br>

Your musing is interrupted by a gentle prod on your backside. A small boy, no older than three, walks into view. He stares up at you, then at your bikini bottoms. He reaches a hand out.<br><br>

<<click [[Try to tell him to stop!|Abduction Shop]]>><<set $trauma to $trauma + 20>><<set $phase to 2>><</click>><br>

<<elseif $phase is 2>>

You can barely murmur, but it's enough. Startled, the boy cries out and runs away. A moment later you hear the voice of a <<person1>><<person>> laugh and console him. "Don't cry. You just have an overactive imagination. Let me show you." A pair of hands clasp round your shoulders and spin you to face the inside of the shop. You see the boy watching you.<br><br>

"See? It's just a doll," the <<person>> prods your waist in demonstration. Prods a little too hard; the force upsets your balance and you fall to the ground. The boy bursts into laughter.<br><br>

Looking somewhat sheepish, the <<person>> picks you up and tries to put you back into position. It's not an easy job to get you stable. Thinking you an object, <<he>> callously manhandles you, gripping you by whichever part of your body <<he>> thinks will help until <<he>> gets you to stay upright.<br><br><<set $arousal to $arousal + 200>>

Satisfied, <<he>> takes the boy by the hand and leaves you.<br><br>

He prods your <<genitals>> through the thin fabric of the bikini. Curiosity unsated, he yanks the bikini bottoms, which easily come loose and fall to the ground. With your <<genitals>> exposed for all to see, he recommences his investigation into your private area. Before he becomes too confident a voice calls out, "Jacob! What did I say about wandering away?" Startled, the boy ceases his adventure and moves away from you.<br><br><<set $arousal to $arousal + 400>>

You continue waiting, only now with your <<genitals>> on display. People react much the same way as before, only eyes now linger on your exposed <<genitalsstop>> A few people giggle.<br><br>

After two hours you feel your focus has returned, but the tight straps and forced position have made you physically sore. You are considering trying to loosen your bonds when you are lifted from behind and carried into a back room.<br><br>

As you are placed on the ground your bearer is revealed to be a tall man in his thirties. He talks while undoing your bindings. "Sorry for the short notice! The missing mannequin has shown up, so your services are no longer needed. You did a fine job though! Your payment is on the table there. You can keep the bikini too, it looks good on you." After removing your bindings he leaves the room, shutting the door behind him.<br><br>

True to his word, there's Â£15 on the table, along with a bottle of water, a muffin with some sort of fruit in it, and the bottoms that were stripped from you.<br><br><<set $hunger to $hunger - 500>><<set $thirst to $thirst - 500>><<clotheson>><<endevent>>
