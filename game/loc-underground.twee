You are dragged through a door and down a flight of steps. You hear the sound of rushing water. At the bottom the <<person>> turns on a torch, revealing an old stone corridor leading away into darkness.<<pass15>><br><br>

After walking awhile you come to a metal door. The <<person2>><<person>> knocks, and is answered by a thin opening sliding apart near the top. It closes promptly, and the door opens.<br><br>

<<endcombat>>

You are forced through the door and to your knees before a <<generate1>><<person1>><<personcomma>> who crouches and grabs your neck. <<He>> turns your head to examine one side of your face, then the other, then forces your mouth open and looks inside.

You enter another corridor, lined on one side with metal floor hatches. <<He>> opens one of them, and shoves you inside. You land on something soft at least. "Your role here is simple.

You fumble around in the dark, and find you fell on what feels like a mattress. There's also a locked metal door and a tap in the corner, but the room is otherwise bare.<br><br>
