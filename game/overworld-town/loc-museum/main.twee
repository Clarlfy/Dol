You find Winter trying to balance a brass pot on a pedestal. <<npc Winter>><<person1>>

<<if $submissive gte 1150>>
"I-I'd like to help demonstrate the horse," you say.
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
"That won't fit on there," you say. "Anyway, I'd like to help demonstrate your wooden horse."
<<else>>
"I've thought about it," you say. "I'd like to help demonstrate the wooden horse."
<</if>>
<br><br>

Winter smiles. "I'm glad to hear it," <<he>> says. <<He>> places the pot in a surer spot and disappears into a back room. When <<he>> emerges <<he>> holds a bundle of taut rags.
<br><br>

"This is the outfit." <<He>> holds the cloth out so you can see. They still just look like rags. You're not sure how you could wear them. Or how much they would cover. "They're sturdier than they look. Get dressed and I'll get the camera. We'll need to advertise. A picture of you looking the part should suffice."
<br><br>

Winter disappears once more. You undress and wrap one rag around your waist, where it almost feels like a skirt. The other you wrap around your chest. It's enough to cover your <<breastsstop>>
<br><br>

<<He>> returns with the camera, and smiles. "Perfect. Try to look scared." <<He>> takes a picture, but then pauses. "Would you mind sitting on the horse? We don't need to bother with the binds or anything, but I think that might work better."
<br><br>

You climb atop the wooden horse and ease yourself down. The hard wood pushes between your <<if $vaginaexist is 1>>labia<<else>>testes<</if>>. You try to push your short, taut skirt between your legs for protection, but it's no use. You're not going to be able to sit on this properly without discomfort.
<br><br>

Winter takes a final picture. <<He>> seems satisfied. "Thank you. This should do the trick." <<He>> leaves you to get dressed.

You wear the rags, as taut and revealing as you remember. You wonder how you look. You'll soon have an audience.
<<exhibitionism1>>

Winter returns. <<He>> holds something at <<his>> side. "Perfect." <<He>> pauses. "I'd like to propose something. I don't want you to feel pressured." <<He>> holds the object out in front of you. It's a whip. "There are degrees of authenticity. If it's okay with you, I'd like to weigh you down as they would have in the past. And whip you. Not too hard, but enough to impress."

<br><br>

"Ladies and gentlemen," Winter begins. <<He>> stands on a raised platform beside the horse, addressing an audience of around fifty people. "Our town has a rich history. Of great deeds and heroism yes, but also of tragedy and brutality. Take this <<girlcomma>>" <<He>> gestures at the door, and you <<nervously>> emerge into the museum. A <<person2>><<person>> stands closest to you. <<He>> licks <<his>> lips.
<br><br>

<<person1>>"Caught stealing bread for <<pher>> starving sibling," Winter continues. "<<pShe>> must now face the lord's justice." You climb atop the horse and ease yourself down. You feel it press into your crotch like before.<<masopain 5>><<arousal 1200>>
<br><br>

Winter continues <<his>> speech, talking about the specifics of the horse. And how it was used. <<He>> steps behind you while doing so, and begins to tie your arms. <<He>> works fast, and before long your arms are bound and immobile.
<br><br>

The audience is enraptured by the spectacle. You feel their eyes on your barely-covered <<genitalsstop>> "Of course, humiliation was part of the punishment." <<He>> throws open a chest at <<his>> feet, and reaches in. <<He>> pulls out a metal weight. You see straps dangling from it before <<he>> kneels beside you. <<He>> ties one to your ankle, and gently releases it. It was uncomfortable before, but now it hurts. <<He>> walks around the horse and repeats the process. Your eyes water.
<<masopain 20>>

"That ends our demonstration. Thank you for attending. We hope you found it informative, and we invite you to appreciate the many other antiques we have on display.
