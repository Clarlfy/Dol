<<winter>><<person1>>Winter picks up the small box you brought. "It's a jewellery case," <<he>> says. "They would have made thousands of these. Very few have survived. That the lock still works is a miracle."<br><br>

<<winter>><<person1>>Winter holds the silver ring up to the light and examines it. "Common jewellery," <<he>> says. "And of enduring metal. There's a lot of these around. This one was worn by someone who lived here. There's value there, I think. Thanks for bringing it."<br><br>

<<winter>><<person1>>"The ivory necklace?" Winter says. "I have to send it away. Terrible shame, but I was told to inform the mayor's office should I acquire anything fitting that description.
