	The thugs drag you away. Bailey comes by eventually.

	Bailey drags Robin away. You struggle against the thugs' grip, but they don't let go until Robin and Bailey are far out of sight.
	<br>
	Robin doesn't actually get punished because this is a debug passage, but in the real thing, something terrible would happen. Maybe the docks, maybe something new.
