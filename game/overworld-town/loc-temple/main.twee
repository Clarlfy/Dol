You nod. That's expensive, but you don't think there's any other way.

You repress the urge to spit in their holy water. That's a lot of money, but you can't think of any other way.

"Wait here child," <<he>> says. "I will gather the others." <<He>> disappears through an archway. When <<he>> returns <<he>> is followed by five robed figures. They surround you as Jordan kneels in front of you, arms outstretched and holding a length of cloth. One of the <<monks>> reaches over your shoulders and takes the fabric. <<He>> wraps it around your head, blinding you.<br><br>

"Now we must travel to the altar. Don't worry, we'll be with you at all times."<br><br> They guide you outside. The soft ground and muffled sound of traffic suggest they're taking you into the forest.<br><br>

You walk for some time. They must be careful with the route they're leading you through, as you have no difficulty and your unease at walking while blind soon fades. Occasionally the group stops and you bump into whoever's in front of you. You hear someone move a branch out of way before continuing.<br><br>

The group stops once more, but this time someone rests their hand on your arm. You hear Jordan's voice. "We're here." <<He>> lifts your hand and places it on something cold and hard. "This is an altar. You'll need to lie on top of it. First though, your clothes."<br><br>

The <<monks>> grasp your clothing and try to remove it. Between your blindness and the sheer number of hands pulling and tugging there's nothing you can do to stop them. They soon have you stripped and bare. <<covered>> <<gtrauma>><br><br>

<<if $worn.under_lower.type.includes("chastity")>>
Someone grabs hold of your $worn.under_lower.name and you hear a grinding sound. A cool breeze caresses your <<genitals>> directly. "We've opened your belt for the ceremony. We'll protect you again afterwards."<br><br>

"Hush child," Jordan says. "Lie atop the altar. This won't take long." You've come this far. You lie on the altar. "Good. Spread your arms and legs please. Yes like that." Something wraps around each of your limbs, tensing them and holding them in place. You can't move an inch.<br><br>

"Okay," Jordan says again. <<He>> sounds breathless. "I'm sorry, I've not done this before."<br><br>

"You'll do fine," one of the <<monks>> says. <<He>> sounds older. "We're all here to help you."<br><br>

"Thank you. Okay. Here I go." You feel a warm breeze on your <<genitalscomma>> then something warm and wet touches it.<br><br>

"Just keep working it with your tongue. Be careful not to take it into your mouth."
<<else>>
"Just keep working it with your tongue. Be careful not to penetrate."
<</if>>

<br><br>

You feel Jordan's tongue lick and twist against your <<genitalsstop>> You can't predict where or how rough <<his>> next lick will be. The anticipation is almost as maddening as the physical sensation itself.<br><br>

<<set $arousal += 10000>>
<<orgasmpassage>>

"I did it, it!" Jordan shouts, excited. "Did it work?"<br><br>

"Not yet," the older <<monk>> responds. "Keep it up."<br><br>

Jordan gets back to work, not even giving your spasms a chance to subside. "This is taking too long," says a younger voice to your right. "I'm helping." You feel a second tongue, this time on your nipple. The surprise makes you jerk away, but your bonds prevent you from moving.<br><br>

"Good idea," the older <<monk>> says. "You. Help <<him>> out." Another tongue appears on your other nipple. Together, the teasing and licking is too much.<br><br>

<<set $arousal += 10000>>
<<orgasmpassage>>

"It's still not working," Jordan says, disheartened.<br><br>

"Don't be silly," the older <<monk>> responds. "We just need a little something extra. Move out the way and lift up <<pher>> legs." Jordan practically climbs on top of you. Your legs are released and lifted, then pressed against your shoulders where they are tied in place once more. You couldn't be more exposed.<br><br>

"This might be a bit awkward. No not there! That's it. Now we can both reach <<phimstop>> You two, you need to help too. If this doesn't remove the taint, nothing will." They recommence their licking. This time though, two tongues assault your <<genitalsstop>>

<<if $penisexist is 1 and $vaginaexist isnot 1>>
The second ranges further down, licking your testes. <<He>> even takes one into <<his>> mouth.

The final two <<monks>> don't seem confident, but they comply and start licking your arms. "Not like that. Lick <<pher>> face."<br><br>

And so you lie there, naked and assailed by tongues on your <<genitalscomma>> <<breasts>> and face, shaking against the bonds holding you in place. One of the <<monks>> licking your face becomes more confident and starts licking your lips. You feel your mouth open of its own accord, and <<he>> invades you with <<his>> tongue, pressing your lips together in a kiss.<br><br>

You awaken back at the temple. You're lying on a small bed in a little room. Jordan sits in the corner, and blushes when <<he>> sees you awake. "The ceremony went as planned. You are forgiven." <<He>> avoids making eye contact. "Thank you for your contribution. Please though, do not tell anyone about what occurred during the ceremony. We like to keep our secrets." <<He>> bows and leaves you alone.<br><br>
