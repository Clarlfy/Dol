Not wanting to cause a fuss, you decide to put up with it. Fortunately, they don't take things too far, content to poke you with rulers when River isn't looking.

<<He>> screams and lurches away from you, clutching <<his>> injury. <<He>> stares at you with wide eyes, seemingly lost for words. Most of the class look amused. "You... Det..." <<he>> stammers.
