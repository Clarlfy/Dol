    <<if $crime gte 10000>><span class="red">you are on the "most wanted" list and they plan to punish you severely.</span>
    <<elseif $crime gte 4500>><span class="red">your arrest is a priority and they have enough on you to warrant extreme punishment.</span>
    <<elseif $crime gte 4000>><span class="red">your arrest is being actively sought</span> and they have enough on you to warrant <span class="red">heavy punishment.</span>
    <<elseif $crime gte 3000>><span class="red">an arrest warrant has been issued for you</span> and they have enough to warrant <span class="red">serious punishment.</span>
    <<elseif $crime gte 2000>><span class="red">an arrest warrant has been issued</span> for you and they have enough to warrant significant punishment.
    <<elseif $crime gte 1000>><span class="red">an arrest warrant</span> has been issued for you. They have enough evidence to warrant a punishment.
    <<elseif $crime gte 500>><span class="gold">they may soon have enough on you to issue an arrest warrant.</span>

        <span class="teal">Framing someone</span> will attach all the evidence on you to someone else. This should mislead the police.
        However, you can only attach it to those who already have a record in the system.<br><br>
