	<<He>> glares at you, but you notice <<his>> arms uncrossing.

	Eventually, he stops glaring, and looks away, looking crestfallen.

	"Fine. Don't come back with me then. I'll just go home." <<he>> starts to move off. <<He>> stops, turning to face you again. "But I will check up on you. I need to see you again. Properly.".

	"Yes. I mean no! Not more... There's just things, and I've got to do them. And I just didn't get time..." You can tell by <<his>> expression that you're not helping yourself, and you stammer your way into silence.
	<br><br>

	"Bullshit!" <<he>> spits angrily. <<He>> looks upset.
	<br><br>

	"I came out of the forest today to come and see you, to make sure you were okay, to bring you home. I should've stayed at home.". <<He>> doesn't look at you.

<<He>> leads you upstairs, and you find yourself going towards the clothes shop.
"Just got a few bits I want to look at." <<he>> tells you.
<br><br>

You enter the clothes shop with Eden. <<He>> starts browsing around seemingly at random.
<<if $NPCName[$NPCNameList.indexOf("Eden")].love gte 100>>
	Suddenly, without warning, Eden starts putting on ridiculous clothes at random. <<He>> looks at you, completely innocently, and the spectical is so comical, you errupt in laughter.
	Eden grins, it seems <<he>> isn't as fashion hopeless as you started to fear. You both laugh, before Eden starts replacing the random items of clothing. <<lstress>><<stress -10>>

Eden walks over towards the underwear section. You wonder whether to give <<him>> some privacy, but when you hang back, <<he>> gestures for you to come with <<him>>.
<<He>> starts picking out a variety of different types of underwear. "These are for you." <<he>> says.
When <<he>> has a small armfull, <<he>> heads towards the changing rooms. You follow along, and <<he>> goes inside with you.
<br><br>
"I want you to try these on for me." <<he>> says, closing the door behind both of you.
<br><br>
"I don't think we're supposed to..."
<br><br>
"They won't know." <<he>> says, and stands watching you expectantly.

<<He>> holds out the first item to you,

	a pair of boyshorts.
