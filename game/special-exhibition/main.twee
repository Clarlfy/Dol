You drop to your hands and knees and sneak up to the end of the alleyway. There's a stall carrying fruit very close by, sneaking under it shouldn't be a problem. There's no way to see how easy it will be from that point on though.<br><br>

You dart beneath the sheet covering the stall. There's another stall adjacent to this one, so you sneak under that one next, leaving the dubious safety of the alley further behind. The market is closely packed so you are able to move quite far, but eventually you come to a gap in the middle of the road. Surrounded by voices, you feel very conscious of your <<nuditystop>><br><br>

You peek up and down the road, and see a car parked between the rows of stalls. The owner is busy loading it with boxes. The vehicle barely fits, so should be able to cross by sneaking beneath it, if you're quick. You hasten toward it.<br><br>

<<generate1>><<person1>>You don't get far. A <<person>> picks this moment to look beneath their stall, and immediately spots you. Their initial look of bewilderment quickly turns mischievous. "I didn't know I had any of you in stock. Here's what's going to happen. You're going to <<if $NPC[0].penis isnot "none">>suck my dick<<else>>lick my pussy<</if>>, and whatever else I feel like, or everyone here will find out what a little harlot you are."<br><br>

	<<else>>

You arrive at the stall beside the car, but find it gone. You didn't hear it move above the clamour of the market. What you do hear, however, is the stall behind you being moved. You lean over a storm drain and peek beneath the sheet, and see it being carried away by a group of people. You look around for another way out, but this stall now stands alone; you're trapped. The group soon return and surround the stall. You hear one of them speak. "On the count of three..." They're going to move this one too!<br><br>

Your only options are to grab hold of the underside of the stall and be carried with it, or take your chances in the storm drain.<br><br>

You manage to get there in time and, lying prone, shuffle beneath it. You continue to the other side and slink beneath another stall. From there, it's easy to remain concealed as you make your way across the street. Placing your head against the ground, you flick up the cover of the final stall to make sure the way forward is safe. Heart thumping in your chest, you dart into the alleyway, leaving the bustle behind you.<br><br>

"Fine," the <<person>> grabs you by the neck and drags you into the daylight. "Look everyone." <<He>> shouts. "Look what I found!"

You grab the underside of the stall and are hoisted into the air with it. The ride is too bumpy and your grip slips, causing you to drop painfully to the ground. The stall moves on without you, leaving you uncovered in the middle of the crowded street.

You move as quickly as your legs will carry you, trying to escape the laughter, whistling and jeers. You run into an alleyway and round a corner, out of sight of the road, before feeling safe enough to process what just happened. So many people saw you. Your feelings of disgrace are made all the worse by the fluid you feel leaking from your <<genitalsstop>><br><br>

When no one is looking, you sneak up to the fence between the park and depot. You squeeze through the bars and peer into the nearest open crate. There are several ceramic containers. It'll be tight, but there should be room for you to hide.

You climb into the crate and pull the lid on after you. It's a snug fit, but that might make the journey easier. You wait.

Without warning, the crate lurches into movement.

			You try to keep calm, surely you won't be moved far. Your thoughts are cut short by a bump in the road, one of the ceramic containers bashes against the side of the crate, shattering it into pieces and disgorging its contents all over you. In the tumult, you don't realise what the contents are until you feel them wriggling; it was full of thick, long worms! What's more, the remaining containers sway menacingly now that extra space has been cleared. If they too contain worms, you need to act or you'll soon be swimming in them.
			<br><br>

			The worms aren't just wriggling on top of you, they press against you as if trying to find a way inside. The movement is making your body respond in a way you don't want to admit, you start to heat up.

You drop to your knees and look through the hole. You see another alley, similar to this one, on the other side. Hearing the voices grow louder, you start crawling through the hole.<<set $stripintegrity to 10>><<set $stripobject to "broken brick">><<stripobject>>
<br><br>

It goes well at first. You get your top half through, but your hips are a little too wide. No matter how hard you push, you cannot do it. You try to wiggle backwards, but find you can't move in either direction. You're stuck!
<br><br>

<<generate1>><<generate2>>You realise the voices have stopped just before something pinches your butt.

You crouch behind a dumpster and wait for the voices to pass. Unfortunately, they decide to stop right in front of your hiding place. You peek out and see a <<generate1>><<generate2>><<person1>><<person>> and <<person2>><<personstop>> You stay as still as possible, not wanting to be caught in such a state. They eventually move on, allowing you to continue.<br><br>

You drop to the ground and shuffle beneath a parked car. The vehicle is soon surrounded by people, their feet stepping just inches from you.
<br><br>
<<if $rng gte 81>>
	A few minutes have passed when the engine rumbles into life above you, and the car beings to move. Afraid of being caught surrounded in public with your <<lewdness>> on display, you cling to the underside, allowing it to carry you along. The journey is over soon, and once the driver has vacated you shuffle out into the daylight. You're in the clear for now.
