<<npc Mason>><<person1>>
You swim into the middle of the lake. There Mason swims in a wide circle. <<He>> notices you approach, and faces you, treading water.
<br><br>

"It's nice to see you out here," <<he>> says. "If it's okay though, I'd like to continue my laps." <<He>> swims away before you can get close.

	You swim after <<himcomma>> <span class="green">and manage to close the distance.</span> <<He>> glances over <<his>> shoulder, and swims faster, but still you manage to keep up. You're almost close enough to touch <<him>> when <<he>> stops and turns.
	<br><br>
	
	"I-I see someone's been paying attention in class," <<he>> says. <<He>> holds <<his>> arms beneath the water in a strange way, close to <<his>> body. "If only the rest of the class were so capable. We'd have our own swim team."
	<br><br>
	
	You look down, through the rain-broken water, and see the reason for <<his>> behaviour. <span class="lewd"><<Hes>> naked.</span> Something in your expression must give you away, and <<his>> face turns a deep shade of red.
	<br><br>
	
	"I-I," <<he>> begins, voice quivering. "I prefer swimming like this. It's just more fun."

	You swim after <<himcomma>> <span class="red">but <<hes>> too fast.</span> You'd need to be pretty skilled to match <<himcomma>> let alone catch up.
	<br><br>

	You try to head <<him>> off, but <<he>> swims in unexpected directions. It's as if <<hes>> avoiding you.

You smile at <<himcomma>> and try to look confused.

	"In the rain?" you say. "I like it too."
<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
	"Swimming in the rain isn't that weird," you say. "I like it myself. It's bracing."
<<else>>
	"Don't worry," you say. "I like swimming in the rain too."
<</if>>
<br><br>

<<He>> looks confused for just a moment. "Th-thank you for understanding," <<he>> says, still coveirng <<himself>> beneath the water. "I need to get back to my laps. Keep practicing, you've shown promising skill."
