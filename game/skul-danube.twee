<<generate1>><<generate2>><<generate3>><<generate4>><<generate5>><<generate6>>You awaken in darkness, yet you hear muffled voices all around you. You can barely move; your arms and legs have been hogtied behind your back. There's something lodged in your mouth, gagging you. You think you smell roast vegetables.<br><br>

You hear what sounds like metal clanging on metal, and you are blinded by a sudden light. Polite applause erupts around you before your eyes adjust. Once they do, you find that you're lying exposed and helpless on a platter in the middle of a table, surrounded by <<if $malechance is 0>>women<<elseif $malechance is 100>>men<<else>>people<</if>> in fancy dinner wear. You hear the clink of cutlery on glass and the applause tapers off.<br><br>

<<person1>>A voice behind you speaks. "I hope everyone's enjoyed their evening so far. As you can see, we have something quite special for pudding." <<He>> claps <<his>> hands and you hear doors opening, followed by footsteps. Two pairs of arms grab you by the shoulders and hoist you up, positioning you on your shins and giving you a better view of the room. You see the speaker stood at one end of the table, glass in hand, a proud smile on <<his>> face. <<He>> nods at the pair who lifted you, a <<person2>><<person>> and <<person3>><<person>> each wearing servant's garb.<br><br>

Without warning, both start pouring a cold white liquid on your chest with large wooden ladles. The sensation makes you gasp, eliciting mischievous whispers from some of the guests. It runs over your nipples, making them feel even more raw and sensitive, and doesn't stop there. When it reaches your <<genitals>> the speaker licks <<his>> lips. They aren't going to eat you, surely!<br><br>

More servants enter, carrying baskets full of strawberries.

<<if $undertype is "chastity">>
The host caresses your chastity belt. "It has protection, but that won't matter." One of the servants tapes a pink plastic object to the belt.

A moment later the device fires into activity. The vibrations are powerful, saturating you to the core. You involuntarily jerk at the abrupt sensation and a muffled yelp escapes your gag. <<set $arousal += 4000>><<garousal>><<stress 2>><<gstress>><<trauma 1>><<gtrauma>><br><br>

<<if $arousal gte 10000>><<orgasmpassage>><<danubemeal>><</if>>

The guests take turns dipping their strawberries in the cream covering your body, which is steadily resupplied by the servants. The pool around your knees grows, but they're only interested in scooping the cream directly from your body. They have a particular interest in your nipples, and frequently tease them with fruit. <<set $arousal += 4000>><<garousal>><<stress 2>><<gstress>><<trauma 1>><<gtrauma>><br><br>

<<if $arousal gte 10000>><<orgasmpassage>><<danubemeal>><</if>>

This continues for a time, until another clinking interruption by the host. "I hope you found that enjoyable, it's not every day we can acquire something quite so delectably..." <<person1>>The servants push you face down into the cream before covering you with a lid, reducing the rest of the speech to an inaudible muffle. You feel yourself being lifted and carried, the sound of the host's voice growing fainter.<br><br>

You hear a door opening, and then you fly through the air before landing on hard pavement. A rain of leftover food falls on top of you, and you hear a door close. Did they just dump you out with the trash? Fortunately, the impact loosened your bonds and you manage to struggle your legs free. Your arms remain bound however.<br><br>
<<endevent>>
You have yet to recover your bearings when a growl sends a chill down your back. You realise why they would just dump food onto the ground like this. Three stray dogs advance on you, hunger in their eyes.

<<if $bestialitydisable is "t">>
You flee, dropping cream and strawberries as you go. You manage to escape them, but not without injury. <<beastescape>><br><br>

The host raises <<his>> arms in exasperation. "I am dreadfully sorry. I promise you the supplier won't hear the end of this, mark my words." It seems to placate the guests to some extent. You wonder if they'll remove the instrument from your body, but they do not.
